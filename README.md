An interative pathfinding visualizer written in Zig using Raylib.

1. Depth First Search
2. Breadth First Search
3. A* Search

- **Maze Loading**: Loads a maze from a text file where walls are represented by `#` and empty paths by `.`.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Supports a range of common search algorithms.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Visualizes the search process in real-time using Raylib.
- **Customizable Start and End Points**: Allows specifying the start and end positions for the pathfinding.

## Requirements

- **Zig**: Ensure you have Zig installed on your system. You can download it from [ziglang.org](https://ziglang.org/).
- **Raylib**: The application uses Raylib for rendering. It should be downloaded and built as part of the Zig build process.

## Installation

### Run locally

To build for your native platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/justinhj/zigpath.git
   cd zigpath
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   zig build
   ```

3. Run the application:
See [Usage](#usage).

### Run in the browser

To build the wasm/Emscripten version, ensure you have the Emscripten SDK installed. You can follow the instructions at [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).

``` sh
zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall --sysroot ${EMSDK}/upstream/emscripten
```

## Usage

### Command Line Arguments

The application requires the following command line argument(s):

- `<file_path>`: Path to the maze file.

### Example

```sh
./zig-out/bin/zigpath ./resources/maze5
```

## Maze File Format

The maze file should be a text file where:
- `#` represents a wall.
- `.` represents an empty path.

Example maze file (`maze.txt`):

```
#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#.#
```

### Example of running in the browser

```sh
cd zig-out/html
emrun --browser safari index.html
```

## Code Structure

- main.zig - The main program that orchestrates the pathfinding and visualization.
- queue.zig - Queue implemented via a circular buffer.
- binaryheap.zig - Binary heap used to provide efficient best first retrieval of next candidates.
