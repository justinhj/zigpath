# Zig Pathfinder

Zig Pathfinder is a maze-solving application written in Zig. It visualizes the process of finding a path through a maze using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). The application leverages the Raylib library for rendering the maze and the search process in real-time.

## Features

- **Maze Loading**: Loads a maze from a text file where walls are represented by `#` and empty paths by `.`.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Supports both Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Visualizes the search process in real-time using Raylib.
- **Customizable Start and End Points**: Allows specifying the start and end positions for the pathfinding.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for invalid mazes and out-of-memory scenarios.

## Requirements

- **Zig**: Ensure you have Zig installed on your system. You can download it from [ziglang.org](https://ziglang.org/).
- **Raylib**: The application uses Raylib for rendering. Make sure Raylib is installed and properly linked.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zig-pathfinder.git
   cd zig-pathfinder
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   zig build
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   ./zig-out/bin/zig-pathfinder <file_path> <start_row> <start_col> <end_row> <end_col> <search_type>
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line Arguments

The application requires the following command line arguments:

- `<file_path>`: Path to the maze file.
- `<start_row>`: Starting row position in the maze.
- `<start_col>`: Starting column position in the maze.
- `<end_row>`: Ending row position in the maze.
- `<end_col>`: Ending column position in the maze.
- `<search_type>`: Type of search algorithm to use (`depthfirst` or `breadthfirst`).

### Example

```sh
./zig-out/bin/zig-pathfinder maze.txt 0 0 10 10 depthfirst
```

This command will load the maze from `maze.txt`, start the search from position (0, 0), and attempt to find a path to position (10, 10) using Depth-First Search.

## Maze File Format

The maze file should be a text file where:
- `#` represents a wall.
- `.` represents an empty path.

Example maze file (`maze.txt`):

```
#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#.#
```

## Code Structure

- **`StackCandidates` and `QueueCandidates`**: Implementations of stack and queue data structures for managing candidate positions during the search.
- **`Candidates`**: A union type that can hold either a stack or queue of candidates, depending on the search type.
- **`loadMaze`**: Function to load and parse the maze from a file.
- **`makeVisited` and `freeVisited`**: Functions to manage the visited state of each cell in the maze.
- **`getEmptyNeighbors`**: Function to retrieve empty neighboring cells of a given position.
- **`main`**: The main function that initializes the application, handles command line arguments, and runs the search algorithm.
