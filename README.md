# Zig Pathfinder

This is a small self-learning project to learn Zig and to demonstrate three path finding algorithms visually.

1. Depth First Search
2. Breadth First Search
3. A* Search

- **Maze Loading**: Loads a maze from a text file where walls are represented by `#` and empty paths by `.`.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Supports both Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Visualizes the search process in real-time using Raylib.
- **Customizable Start and End Points**: Allows specifying the start and end positions for the pathfinding.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for invalid mazes and out-of-memory scenarios.

## Requirements

- **Zig**: Ensure you have Zig installed on your system. You can download it from [ziglang.org](https://ziglang.org/).
- **Raylib**: The application uses Raylib for rendering. Make sure Raylib is installed and properly linked.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zig-pathfinder.git
   cd zig-pathfinder
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   zig build
   ```

3. Run the application:
See [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

### Command Line Arguments

The application requires the following command line arguments:

- `<file_path>`: Path to the maze file.
- `<start_row>`: Starting row position in the maze.
- `<start_col>`: Starting column position in the maze.
- `<end_row>`: Ending row position in the maze.
- `<end_col>`: Ending column position in the maze.
- `<search_type>`: Type of search algorithm to use (`depthfirst`, `astar` or `breadthfirst`).

### Example

```sh
./zig-out/bin/zig-pathfinder ./data/maze4 2 2 7 31 astar
```

## Maze File Format

The maze file should be a text file where:
- `#` represents a wall.
- `.` represents an empty path.

Example maze file (`maze.txt`):

```
#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
#.#.#.#.#
```

## Code Structure

- main.zig - The main program that orchestrates the pathfinding and visualization.
- queue.zig - Queue implemented via a circular buffer.
- binaryheap.zig - Binary heap used to provide efficient best first retrieval of next candidates.
